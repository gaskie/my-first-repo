My name is Sean Gaskie.  I'm a physician informaticist working at SCVMC for the CMIO, Phil Strong.
Lin Max is the love of my life.
We live together in Santa Rosa with our cat, Ludwig.
I recently read Jenny Odell's 'How to do Nothing' and have just started "This is not a drill' by the Extinction Rebellion.
